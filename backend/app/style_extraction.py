CRITICAL: Do NOT extract factual content, domain knowledge, or specific information. Focus ONLY on HOW the text is written, not WHAT it says.

Here are the combined texts from historical Vorhabensbeschreibung documents:
---
{combined_text}
---

Extract the following categories of writing style information and present them as a JSON object. Each category should be a list of strings describing patterns, characteristics, or rules.

Categories to extract:
1. structure_patterns: How the document is organized (e.g., "Introduction followed by problem statement", "Chronological narrative structure", "Section-based with numbered subsections")
2. tone_characteristics: The tone and voice used (e.g., "Formal and professional", "Technical but accessible", "Confident and assertive")
3. writing_style_rules: Specific writing conventions observed (e.g., "Uses passive voice for technical descriptions", "Prefers short sentences for emphasis", "Uses bullet points for key points")
4. storytelling_flow: How information is presented narratively (e.g., "Problem-solution narrative", "Progressive disclosure of information", "Builds context before presenting details")
5. common_section_headings: Typical section headings or structural elements (e.g., "Einleitung", "Hintergrund", "Methodik", "Ergebnisse")

IMPORTANT:
- Ignore tables, images, and visual elements (focus only on text)
- Do NOT extract domain-specific facts or content
- Focus on writing patterns, not information content
- If a category has no clear patterns, provide an empty list

Output ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any other text or explanations.
