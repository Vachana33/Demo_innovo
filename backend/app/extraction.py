        website_text: Raw text extracted from company website
        transcript_text: Raw text transcribed from audio recording

    Returns:
        Dictionary with structured company profile containing:

    prompt = f"""You are a data extraction system. Your task is to extract ONLY factual information from the provided text.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Extract ONLY facts that are explicitly stated in the text
- Do NOT generate, create, or invent any information
- Do NOT write prose, descriptions, or funding-style text
- Do NOT paraphrase or summarize - extract exact facts only
- If information is missing, use null (not "unknown" unless explicitly stated)
- Use German for extracted values if the source text is in German
- Use English for keys only

INPUT TEXT:
Website Content:
{website_processed}

Meeting Transcript:
{transcript_processed}

EXTRACTION TASK:
Extract the following structured information. If a field cannot be determined from the text, use null.

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{{
  "industry": "string or null - Company's industry/sector",
  "products_or_services": ["string"] or null - List of products/services mentioned",
  "business_model": "string or null - How the company makes money",
  "market": "string or null - Target market/customers",
  "innovation_focus": "string or null - Innovation focus areas",
  "company_size": "string or null - Company size if mentioned (e.g., '50 employees', 'startup', 'SME')",
  "location": "string or null - Company location if mentioned",
  "known_gaps": ["string"] - List of important information that is missing (e.g., 'revenue', 'founding_year', 'funding_status')
}}

EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:
- industry: Extract the specific industry/sector (e.g., "Healthcare Technology", "Manufacturing", "Software Development")
- products_or_services: Extract specific products/services mentioned (e.g., ["AI diagnostic tools", "Cloud platform"])
- business_model: Extract how company makes money (e.g., "B2B SaaS", "Product sales", "Consulting services")
- market: Extract target market (e.g., "Healthcare providers", "SMEs in Germany", "Enterprise customers")
- innovation_focus: Extract innovation areas (e.g., "AI/ML", "IoT", "Digital transformation")
- company_size: Extract if mentioned (e.g., "50 employees", "startup", "SME", "50-100 employees")
- location: Extract if mentioned (e.g., "Berlin, Germany", "Munich")
- known_gaps: List what important information is missing (e.g., ["revenue", "founding_year", "funding_status", "key_competitors"])

IMPORTANT:
- Return ONLY valid JSON
- Do NOT include any text outside the JSON object
- Do NOT add explanations or comments
- Use null for missing information (not "unknown" or "not mentioned")
- Extract facts only - no creative writing or generation"""
